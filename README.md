# Holt–Winters Finetuned Ensemble for Adaptive Forecasting

## 📌 Project Purpose
This project implements finetuned Holt–Winters ensemble trackers for adaptive time series forecasting.  
It enhances early prediction accuracy and provides robust diagnostic insights for competitive model evaluation.

## 🚀 Features
- Holt Linear, Holt–Winters Additive, and Holt–Winters Multiplicative models
- Ensemble approach with likelihood weighting for adaptive forecasts
- Diagnostic outputs (loc, scale, likelihood scores) for transparency
- Configurable parameters for fine‑tuning across different datasets
- Ready for competition environments (e.g., CrunchDAO)
